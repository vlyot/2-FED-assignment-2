## COVID-19 Interactive Web Map
COVID-19 in the world has become so prominent, it all started with one country and ended with all. The COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on not only the world, but us human beings and our daily lives. From moving from face-to-face learning / working to home based learning or working from home. Hence the need for us to adapt, which we did perfectly. Besides the project that we have been working on is targeted at the public, or those users who seek to find out more information about COVID-19. Through the easy use of the interactive map, and other navigation functions, users will be able to navigate through the website to immerse themselves in new knowledge of COVID-19.

A standout feature of our website lies in its cutting-edge interactive map, which leverages a sophisticated API to provide users with real-time data on COVID-19 cases worldwide. This dynamic tool is designed for user engagement, employing an intuitive hover-over effect that seamlessly reveals detailed information about individual countries, including the current number of COVID-19 cases. This real-time functionality not only enhances user experience but also ensures that our audience stays informed with the latest and most accurate data available.

## Design Process

The design process of our interactive web map was a meticulous and passionate endeavour, driven by a profound commitment to comprehensively address the multifaceted aspects of COVID-19 and its far-reaching impacts. The process began with an in-depth analysis of user needs and the specific information users sought regarding the pandemic. We conducted thorough research on COVID-19 data sources and selected a robust API to ensure real-time and accurate information for our users.

The conceptualization phase involved sketching out various design ideas and user interface (UI) layouts. We prioritized simplicity and intuitiveness to cater to a diverse audience, ensuring that users, including the general public and healthcare officials, could easily navigate and extract valuable insights from the map.
The development phase involved leveraging advanced web technologies to implement the interactive features seamlessly. The API integration was executed to fetch and update COVID-19 data in real time.

You can see more about the prototyping in the WireFrames & Mock Ups folder.


## Features:
### Loading Screen:
Through the incorporation of Lottie animations, it will allow us to create a visually appealing loading screen where users will wait 3 seconds before they load into the home page of the website. We intend to make it visually appealing so that we can make the user interface design look better and more intriguing to the user. Using JSON to store animation data, and the use of CSS, JavaScript and HTML we will be able to make this loading screen.


### Home Page:
The home page is the main page where users ( general public ) see when they visit the website. It contains the websites overview and navigations. On the top left-hand corner there are navigation buttons where it will help you locate the other pages on the website. 
On the top right-hand corner. There are icons which will link you to the company’s Instagram page, twitter page, Facebook page, and TikTok page. This will allow users to navigate to their social media sites where they can see what the company posts about COVID-19. 

### Dropdown Menu:
On all the pages, we will implement a drop-down menu where users can easily navigate through the pages of the website. The drop-down menu will be located on the top left-hand side next to the icons. 
The dropdown menu will be triggered by a click on the mouse. This would be implemented through JavaScript and CSS. When the drop-down list appears, uses can then click on the relevant page they want to be brought to. There they can read more information about COVID-19. After selecting a page, the drop-down menu will automatically close. 
We should be doing just a simple drop-down menu, with a list of options where the users can select from. 

### Interactive Map:
We have planned to make an interactive map which would be made movable by a mouse. Hence implementing the click and drag function where the users can do with a mouse or a trackpad. We intend to use the map of Asia, and the covid cases around Asia since COVID-19 started in China. 
Hover over function. When dragged to a country, and the cursor is on top of the country on the map, there should be a pop-up where it will tell users about the news of COVID in that country, amount of people affected, recovered and the number of deaths in that country. 

### Learn More Page:
This is the page that would be linked to the quiz page. To find out more about COVID-19 this is the page to be at. This page helps users understand the policies in the countries and the policies by WHO. The rules of the country too will be stated here, and the measures taken to stop COVID-19 from spreading. 
There will be a link to the quiz page also.

### Quiz Page:
Just for fun and games, to test users about COVID-19 and the measures taken. Small little quiz for them to complete and test their knowledge on COVID-19.

### Timeline Page: 
This is to let readers / users know more about COVID-19 and when did it all start and where. Basically it is a timeline throughout the years of 2019-2021. Where countries faced COVID-19 spikes and drops over these years

### Footers:
At the bottom of all the pages. There will be a footer. Where users can sign up, type in their email addresses, and their names. It is also possible for them to type a message so that the company can read the message and possibly answer questions if there are any.


### FAQ / Policies:
Right next to the footers, there will two tabs which are FAQ and Policies. This is where users can go if they want to see frequently asked questions or the policies about COVID-19. 

### Icons:
The icons on the top right hand side of the page will lead the user to the companies social media pages for them to have a better understanding of COVID-19 and also about the company.


### Images:
The use of images will help entice the users looking at the page, also to not make it so boring when the users read all the information provided by us.


### Hover Over:
The hover-over function in an interactive map serves as a valuable user interface feature that enhances the user experience by providing additional information or context when the user hovers their cursor over a specific area or element on the map.

###Chapter-based indexing for content 
When users read through our articles, they will not need to waste time scrolling through the page to find their desired chapter. They can easily click on one of the chapters on our side menus and our website will find the chapter and scroll to it for them.

###Add to cart function:
Suitable for the store page, where it is easy for users to add products into their cart and then checking out. With the cart displaying what they have added and calculating the total cost for them.
